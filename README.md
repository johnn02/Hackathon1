# Hackathon Submission
Our app name is OurSejahtera. We created the app on Android, using Android Studio and an android virtual device.
Using a code template, we created our prototype that consists of 3 pages.

The first page is a registration form where users can input their information such as name, IC and addresss.
The second page is a progress tracking page where users can track the progress of the saliva package.
The third page is the result page where users can obtain results of test. There is a also a form for users to rate/describe their symptoms so that the app can determine if a user should be scheduled an appointment at the hospital for further examination. Users can also live chat with a doctor if they are unsure of the symptoms.

The 3 pages are coded in Java and the page layout is coded using XML.
