# Hackathon Submission
Our app name is OurSejahtera. Our app digitialises the self-testing process by allowing users to submit a saliva sample for Covid testing. This enables users to avoid visiting medical centres and thus reduce the spread of Covid.

We designed the app to work on Andriod, using Android Studio and an android virtual device. We created our prototype that consists of 3 pages.

The first page is a registration form where users can input their information such as name, IC and addresss.
The second page is a progress tracking page where users can track the progress of the saliva package.
The third page is the result page where users can obtain results of the test. There is a also a form for users to rate/describe their symptoms so that the app can determine if a user should be scheduled an appointment at the hospital for further examination. Users can also live chat with a doctor if they are unsure of the symptoms.

The 3 pages are coded in Java and the page layout is coded using XML.
